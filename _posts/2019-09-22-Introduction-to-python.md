Hello Everyone, in this series I am going to teach you about the basic python you needed to get started.

### So, let’s know first WHY PYTHON?

- Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming.

- Python has more power & it has many libraries available. So, it is a very powerful language.

- Python has very high support on many websites so you can easily resolve your problems.

### What Python can do?

- Python is a fully functional programming language with that you can do anything which you can do with other languages.

- In Python, there are “Modules” which are written in python languages which you can import and make your life little easy.

- Python can be used to make games, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, create websites, GUI applications.

So, let’s get started.

## Python Set up

### For Linux or Mac OS etc:

No worry you got python installed by default in your OS. You can check by opening the “Terminal window” and type “Python”

{% highlight python %}

~/python-exercises$ python
Python3.5.1 (r2:14541,Jan 06 2018, 07:57:53)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5363)] on mypc
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

{% endhighlight %}


<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- horizontal -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2975147576456254"
     data-ad-slot="4059282902"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

### For Windows:

- You need to go [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) download page, select the version 3.x which is stable and best.

- Run the Python installer, taking all the defaults. This will install Python in the root directory and set up some file associations.

- Now Search and open IDLE.

## First Program:

Type “print(“Hello World”)” directly in you IDLE or Terminal (Linux or Mac).

{% highlight python %}

>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World

{% endhighlight %}

wow, it’s that simple.

Congratulation, you just completed your first python program.

In the next series, we will learn more about python. So be connected. Thanks for visiting.
