Hi there, I'm Atri Saxena, :)

I post graduated from M.Tech in Information Security from NIT Jalandhar, Jalandhar. My research was mainly focused on Deep learning and Computer Vision.

I'm a big fan of Automation, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm doing some works on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm also maintaining this blog to share my knowledge about ML and CV, as well as my work on both fields. You can find all my undergoing projects here on github: [My GitHub](https://github.com/atrisaxena).


Hope this blog help with your learning. And don't hesitate to drop me a line. I'll reply as soon as I can, promise!
